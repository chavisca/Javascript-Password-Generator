# Javascript-Password-Generator

## Description

This project is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of Javascript.  
This project is also meant to refactor code in order to add features to an existing password generator.  
This is a very useful exercise in using validation for functions, using the concat method, and iterative for loops.
